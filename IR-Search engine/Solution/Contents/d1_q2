The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are the premier autonomous public technical and research universities located across India.[1] They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, which has declared them as Institutes of National Importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance.[2][3] The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 lists twenty-three institutes.[4] Each IIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council (IIT Council), which oversees their administration. The Minister of Education is the ex officio Chairperson of the IIT Council.[5] As of 2020[update], the total number of seats for undergraduate programs in all IITs is 16,053.[6]
