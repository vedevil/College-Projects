Computer science Specializations and courses teach software engineering and design, algorithmic thinking, human-computer interaction, programming languages, and the history of computing. Courses in this broad field will help you think abstractly, approach problems methodically, and develop sound solutions.Computers are an essential part of our internet-enabled lives today, but what does it mean to study computer science? Computer science, often referred to as CS, is a broad field encompassing the study of computer systems, computational thinking and theory, and the design of software programs that harness the power of this hardware to process data.
