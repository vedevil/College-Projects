### **This folder contains only one file conataining code for knn implementation from scratch:**

> **Part of the code is inspired from <code>https://github.com/python-engineer/MLfromscratch/blob/master/mlfromscratch/knn.py</code>.**

> **It is taken as it is more structure and close to scikit learn implementation.**

### **Results (nearest_neighbours=10):**

<code>
With flattening we achieved 73.3% accuracy.
